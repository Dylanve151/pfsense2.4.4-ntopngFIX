# pfsense2.4.4-ntopngFIX

GeoIP stopped working so i fixed it.

I hope it will be usefull for you ;)

Update GeoIP Data button seems to be working fine with this

# file locations:

/usr/local/bin/geoipupdate.sh (Not needed I think)

/usr/local/pkg/ntopng.inc


# Needs fixing but I am to lazy

ntopng service stops after pressing the Update GeoIP Data button.

Last part of geoipupdate.sh
